"""TDD: verify Prop 22 migration schema and seed data.

These tests confirm that:
1. ride_requests has 5 new prop22_* columns
2. orders has 5 new prop22_* columns
3. prop22_config has the 2026 CA seed row (multiplier=1.20, mile_rate=0.37)
4. prop22_city_wages has 5 seed rows (CA + SF x2 + LA x2)
5. prop22_earning_periods has the uq_prop22_period_driver_start unique constraint
6. All 4 new ORM classes are importable from models.py

Requires a live database with the migration applied (alembic upgrade head).
